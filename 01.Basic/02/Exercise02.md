1. Basic Data Types
- Exercise: Declare variables of different basic types and output their sizes.
    * Declare variables of types int, float, double, char, and bool.
    * Use sizeof() to print the size of each data type.
    * Assign sample values to each variable and print their values.
2. Type Modifiers
- Exercise: Declare variables using type modifiers and observe their value ranges.
    * Declare variables with modifiers short, long, unsigned, and signed for the int type.
    * Assign values to test the range limits of these types.
    * Output each value and the memory size using sizeof().
3. Boolean Data Type
- Exercise: Write a program to demonstrate the bool data type.
    * Declare two boolean variables, isEven and isPositive.
    * Ask the user to enter a number.
    * Set isEven to true if the number is even, and isPositive to true if the number is positive.
    * Output the values of isEven and isPositive.
4. Floating-Point Precision
- Exercise: Compare the precision of float and double.
    * Declare a float variable and a double variable, both with the same large decimal value.
    * Output the values to see the difference in precision.
5. Character Type
- Exercise: Experiment with the char type and ASCII values.
    * Declare a char variable and assign it a character.
    * Output the ASCII value of the character.
    * Assign the variable an ASCII value directly (e.g., 65) and print the corresponding character.
6. Integer Overflow
- Exercise: Observe overflow behavior in integers.
    * Declare an unsigned int variable and assign it the maximum value possible.
    * Increment the variable by 1 and output the result.
    * Do the same with a signed int to observe overflow behavior.
7. Arithmetic with Mixed Types
- Exercise: Perform arithmetic operations between different types.
    * Declare an int, float, and double variable.
    * Add the int and float, store it in a double variable, and print the result.
    * Observe and comment on the output.
