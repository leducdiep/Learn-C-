This is the code repository for Learn C++ Programming

# Basic Topics in C++ Programming

1. Basic Syntax and Structure:
    * Understanding main() function, headers, namespaces, and comments.
2. Data Types and Variables:
    * Built-in types like int, float, double, char, bool, and type modifiers.
3. Control Structures:
    * if statements, switch statements, loops (for, while, do-while).
4. Functions:
    * Declaring and defining functions, return types, parameters, function overloading.
5. Arrays and Strings:
    * Defining, initializing, and manipulating arrays and C-style strings.
6. Pointers and References:
    * Basic use of pointers, dereferencing, and references.
7. Structs and Enums:
    * Creating and using structures and enumerations.
8. Basic Input and Output:
    * Using cin, cout, file I/O with ifstream and ofstream.
9. Dynamic Memory Management:
    * Using new and delete for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
10. Error Handling:
    * Basic use of try, catch, and throw.

# Intermediate Topics in C++ Programming

11. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
    * Classes and objects, constructors, destructors, member functions, and encapsulation.
12. Inheritance and Polymorphism:
    * Types of inheritance, virtual functions, overriding, and dynamic polymorphism.
13. Operator Overloading:
    * Overloading arithmetic and relational operators for custom behavior.
14. Templates:
    * Function templates and class templates for generic programming.
15. Standard Template Library (STL):
    * Understanding and using containers (vector, list, map, set), iterators, and algorithms.
16. Smart Pointers:
    * Using unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr for better memory management.
17. File Handling and Serialization:
    *Advanced file operations, binary file handling, serialization of data.
18. Namespaces:
    * Organizing code with namespaces to avoid naming conflicts.

# Advanced Topics in C++ Programming

19. Lambda Expressions:
    * Using lambdas for inline functions, especially with STL algorithms.
20. Advanced Memory Management:
    * Concepts like shallow copy vs. deep copy, custom allocators, and memory pools.
21. Multithreading and Concurrency:
    * Using the <thread> library, synchronization with mutex and condition_variable.
22. Move Semantics and Rvalue References:
    * Understanding std::move, rvalue references, and move constructors for efficient resource management.
23. Exception-Safe Code:
    * Writing robust, exception-safe code with RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and noexcept.
24. Design Patterns:
    * Common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Visitor patterns.
25. Metaprogramming:
    * Basics of template metaprogramming and using constexpr for compile-time computations.
26. Advanced STL:
    * Customizing and creating STL-compatible iterators, using STL algorithms effectively.
27. Networking and Socket Programming:
    * Basic network communication using sockets, often through third-party libraries.
28. C++ and Low-Level Programming:
    * Understanding inline assembly, interaction with hardware, memory-mapped IO (useful in embedded systems).
29. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Programming:
    * Creating GUI applications using libraries like Qt or SFML.
30. Interfacing with Other Languages:
    * Integrating C++ with other languages like C, Python (via Boost.Python or pybind11), or Java.

# Expert-Level Topics

31. Asynchronous Programming:
    * Using async, futures, and promises for asynchronous operations.
32. Custom Memory Management Techniques:
    * Implementing custom memory management systems like garbage collectors or region-based allocators.
33. Compiler and Linker Internals:
    * Understanding how C++ code is compiled and linked, including symbol resolution and linkage.
34. Embedded Programming in C++:
    * Writing efficient C++ code for embedded systems with limited resources.
35. C++ for High-Performance Computing:
    * Techniques for parallel programming, SIMD, and optimizing for modern CPUs.
